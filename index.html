            Once widespread in Asia, Europe, and North Africa, the aurochs is believed to be a wild ancestor of domestic cattle. One of the largest herbivores in the Holocene, their grazing of nuts, twigs, and grass shaped historical ecosystems, and their manure
            supported vast kingdoms of insects and fungi. A prominent participant in human history --- and one of the richest food sources before the advent of agriculture --- aurochs were among the earliest figures to appear in Paleo- and Neolithic cave
            paintings and petroglyphs, and feature across Egyptian reliefs, Bronze Age figurines, and classical literature.

        century, it was already in decline, due perhaps to a changing grassland habitat around the Cape Peninsula. Hunted to extinction by settlers within a century, biologists did not have long to observe the creature's behavior before it vanished

        by passing sailors in need of oil and food, further shrinking when settlers from France and Madagascar began to occupy the island in the seventeenth century. Like its fellow Mascarene giant tortoise species, the animal's slow metabolism allowed
        it to survive without food or water for extended periods, making it perversely suited for being packed into ship holds.

    <article id="popup-20">This wild North American pigeon was named not for its ability to transport passengers, but for its wanderlust tendency to pass by (<em>passager</em>, in the French), before gradually passing out of existence for good, due to hunting and widespread
        deforestation in the nineteenth century. Living in the deciduous groves of eastern North America and breeding around the Great Lakes, the passenger pigeon's population at one point numbered between three and five billion. (A similar number range
        occurs in the dating of its oldest known fossil: from a specimen found in North Carolina estimated to be between 3.6 to 5.3 million years old.) It could reach airborne speeds of sixty-two miles (one hundred kilometers) per hour and caught light
        in its iridescent neck feathers. Wallace Craig <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Passenger_pigeon_notes.jpg">attempted to record</a> a different kind of tonal richness: the male pigeon's vibrant vocalizations, in musical notation
        and phonetic imitation, as it moved gently toward its mate: &quot;kee-kee-kee-kee&quot;, &quot;tete! tete! tete!&quot; This chattering call sounded from one of the most social land birds, whose scale of loss is almost inconceivable: at their peak,

        livestock. The last specimen was collected in 1902, although a senior Hawaiian ornithologist swears to have heard one hidden amid the flanks of the active volcano Mauna Loa in 1934. Notably timid, the nectivorous ʻōʻō had an extended tongue for

        limb. Like other rhinos, it had poor eyesight, forming symbiotic relationships with birds such as the red-billed oxpecker, who helped detect threats. The story of the western black rhinoceros' decline is &quot;a story of greed, indifference, hope

    <article id="popup-37">Once endemic to Christmas Island, the last known forest skink (nicknamed Gump) died in captivity in 2014. Living in leaf litter and covered by rich chocolate-colored scales, this species of skink was abundant in population as late as 1979. During
        the 80s and 90s, forest skink numbers plummeted by ninety-eight percent, alongside <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.358">similar declines</a> in other Christmas Island reptiles, such as the blue-tailed skink, Lister's
        gecko, and the coastal skink.

    <article id="popup-38">Declared extinct and then later revised as &quot;possibly extinct&quot; due to insufficient data, the smooth handfish is thought to have been once commonly found off the coast of Tasmania --- so much so that it was one of the first species noted by
        European colonists. Using pectoral fins to walk across the seabed, the fish were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/21/why-the-death-of-a-small-punk-like-fish-rocked-the-marine-world-aoe">described</a> by Zoe Kean on the

        colonial survey of Australia, this species of handfish <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/smooth-handfish-extinction-marks-a-sad-milestone/">is

    <article id="popup-39">Native to the bottomland hardwood and temperate coniferous forests of Cuba and the Southern United States, the last universally accepted sighting of an American ivory-billed woodpecker was in 1944, while the last Cuban member of this species was spotted
        in 1987. Many subsequent sightings of this bird --- known to be John James Audobon's favorite species --- have been reported, leading to ongoing claims of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1114507">rediscovery</a>. Thought to
        be extinct due to widespread habitat destruction by logging, they once lived on larvae and wild fruits such as hickory nuts and persimmons. They were historically important to Native American groups from the Great Lakes and Great Plains regions,
        who used their bills for trade and ceremonial crafts.
